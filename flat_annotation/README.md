# Flat
**The typesafe, reactive and lightweight SQLite abstraction for your Flutter applications (iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, Windows)**

Don't import this package!
You should be using the [flat_orm](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flat_orm) package, which comes with all the annotations.
Separating the packages brings some benefits for developing the library but not for the users of it.

Check the main repository [README](https://github.com/Amir-P/flat).
